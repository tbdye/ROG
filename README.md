# Railroad Operations Game (ROG)

A persistent backend application with web-based configuration interface for managing railroad operations.

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Ideation

This project is in early planning stages. Implementation has not yet begun.

## Project Overview

ROG (Railroad Operations Game) serves a dual purpose:

1. **Primary Goal:** Build a functional railroad operations management application
2. **Secondary Goal:** Document AI-assisted development workflow for portfolio/content creation

The project follows a structured 6-phase development approach, from ideation through implementation to portfolio content synthesis.
