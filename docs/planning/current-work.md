# ROG - Current Work

**Last Updated:** December 21, 2025
**Session:** Documentation Reorganization + Protocol Updates (In Progress)

---

## What We're Currently Working On

**Updating documentation with improved session protocols:**

1. **Session start protocol enhanced:**
   - Added summary statement (forcing function)
   - Added directory scan (Tier 3 awareness)
   - Added confirmation step for context loading

2. **Session end protocol enhanced:**
   - Added portfolio content preservation (CRITICAL)
   - Added portfolio capture criteria
   - Distinguished checkpoint vs complete scenarios

3. **PR Pre-Flight Checklist added:**
   - Stop and think before creating PR
   - Verify all work in files
   - Portfolio preservation check
   - File updates checklist

4. **Claude.ai references removed:**
   - Removed cross-environment sync sections
   - Updated encoding rationale
   - Simplified to Code CLI only workflow

5. **Date fixes:**
   - Fixed 2025-12-20 topology session filename
   - Fixed all session files from 2024 to 2025 (Sonnet 4.5 year assumption error)

---

## What We Just Completed (Earlier This Session)

**Major reorganization of repository documentation structure:**

1. **Created PRD structure** (ROG source of truth)
   - All requirements, decisions, models in `docs/PRD/`
   - Categorized decision logs with index for easy searching
   - Clear separation from portfolio content

2. **Separated portfolio content** ("The ROG Sessions")
   - Portfolio completely independent in `docs/portfolio/`
   - Never needed for ROG planning
   - Collaboration patterns, presentation artifacts, session narratives

3. **Restructured decision logs:**
   - Categorized: platform, data-models, process
   - Index with grep examples for quick search
   - Removed old monolithic files

---

## Current Phase

**Phase:** Phase 2 - PRD Development
**Progress:** 6/26 questions answered (23%)

**Completed:**
- [x] Q1: Layout Topology Representation
- [x] Q22-26: Platform Architecture

**Next Priority:** Q3 - Geographic Routing Algorithm

---

## What's Next

**Immediate (this session):**
- ✅ Checkpointed before auto-compact (94% context used, 6% remaining)
- ✅ Session summary created (2025-12-21-documentation-reorganization.md)
- ✅ Update CONTRIBUTING.md with PR Pre-Flight Checklist (WORKFLOW-CRITICAL)
- ✅ Fixed all 2024-12-20 date references (corrected to 2025-12-20)
- ✅ Enhanced Tier 3 scanning to be context-aware and intelligent
- ✅ All workflow management changes saved

**Fresh context window (post auto-compact):**
- ✅ Fixed 3 minor issues (PRD/README.md path, current-work.md status, .gitkeep files)
- ✅ Enhanced CLAUDE.md Session Start with explicit 6-step checklist
- ✅ Created comprehensive tag system (29 tags across 6 categories)
- ✅ Tagged all 12 existing decisions with dates, status, and tags
- ✅ Updated decisions-index.md with dates, status, and complete tag documentation
- ✅ Added Decision Documentation Workflow section to CLAUDE.md (CORE WORKFLOW)
- ✅ Added Questions/Assumptions sections to current-work.md template
- ✅ Fixed ALL remaining 2024 date references (4 session files + 7 internal refs + 2 research files)
- ✅ All enhancements complete and ready for PR

**After Checkpoint:**
- Continue refining protocols if needed
- OR prepare for Q3 work

**After Review & Merge:**

**Start Q3 - Geographic Routing Algorithm**

**Context to load:**
- Tier 1 (CORE): CLAUDE.md, PRD/README.md, PRD/overview.md, this file
- Tier 2 (ACTIVE):
  - PRD/data-models.md + PRD/decisions/data-models.md (planning phase - load both)
  - PRD/platform.md (offline sync constraints)
  - planning/specifications/topology-data-model.md (detailed spec)
  - planning/phase2-progress.md (question tracking)

---

## Blockers

(None currently)

---

## Questions for User

**Questions needing answers to proceed with current work:**

(None currently - all questions for Q3 will be added when we start Q3 work)

**Purpose:** Capture blockers requiring user input so they can be answered between sessions.

---

## Assumptions Made

**Assumptions pending validation:**

(None currently - will be added as we make assumptions during Q3 work)

**Purpose:** Surface hidden dependencies and assumptions that may need user confirmation.

## Portfolio Note for This Session

**Meaningful collaboration moments (earlier in session):**
- User's paranoia about losing data ("you should be too") shaped portfolio preservation protocol
- Enhanced context loading with directory scan (human would look in directory)
- PR Pre-Flight Checklist creation (systematic check to prevent loss)
- Portfolio capture criteria refinement

**Meaningful collaboration moments (post auto-compact):**
- User caught 2024 date references - attention to detail, thoroughness
- User's directive on tag system: "If we're going to use tagging, let's go through EVERYTHING and first pass tag everything now"
- Established pattern: Do comprehensive work now, not piecemeal later
- Fresh perspective review identified 3 minor issues + led to comprehensive enhancements

**Patterns observed:**
- User systematically identified gaps in session management protocols
- User values thoroughness over incrementalism ("Why not do both now?")
- User catches details AI might miss (2024 dates in filenames)

## Session Continuity Notes

**To resume:**
1. Say: "Start ROG session" or "Resume ROG work"
2. Claude loads this file + Tier 1 context automatically
3. Claude provides summary and recommends Tier 2 files
4. Confirm context loading

**To prepare for next session:**
- Ask: "What should I prepare for Question 3?"
- Get specific questions about branch detection, routing scenarios, definitions needed
- Come back with answers ready to accelerate collaboration

**Critical:**
- All work must be in files before checkpointing/completing
- Portfolio content preserved when meaningful interactions occur
- PR Pre-Flight Checklist before creating any PR
