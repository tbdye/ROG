# Session Summary - December 6, 2024

**Phase:** Phase 0 - Planning Setup  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Next Phase:** Phase 1 - Ideation

---

## What We Accomplished

### Documents Created
1. **ROG-PROJECT-GUIDELINES.md** - Comprehensive project framework
2. **ROG-DECISION-LOG.md** - Collaboration narrative tracker
3. **Session-2024-12-06-summary.md** - This summary

### Key Decisions Made

**Project Structure:**
- Dual purpose: Build ROG app + Document AI workflow for portfolio
- Tool ecosystem: Claude.ai (planning), Claude Code CLI (implementation), GitHub, VSCode
- Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5
- No tech stack preferences yet - will be driven by requirements

**Workflow Phases Defined:**
- Phase 0: Planning Setup ✅
- Phase 1: Ideation (Next)
- Phase 2: PRD Development
- Phase 3: Implementation Planning
- Phase 4: Detailed Task Breakdown
- Phase 5: Implementation (Claude Code CLI)
- Phase 6: Portfolio Content Synthesis (Separate project)

**Operational Protocols Established:**
- Token warning thresholds: 80%, 90%, 95% (mandatory stop)
- Multi-layer content preservation strategy
- File sync workflow clarified (download → save local → upload to Project)
- Decision log for tracking collaboration patterns
- Session summaries at conversation end

**Content Capture Strategy:**
- Focus: Human-AI collaboration patterns, not raw technical output
- Track: How human guides AI, pivots, critical moments
- Challenge: Organize vast content later
- Solution: Decision Log + conversation search in Phase 6

### Portfolio-Worthy Moments Logged

**Entry #1:** Project framing - human articulated focus on collaboration patterns  
**Entry #2:** Iterative refinement - structured feedback process  
**Entry #3:** Anticipatory problem-solving - operational questions upfront  
**Entry #4:** File download misunderstanding - making implicit workflows explicit

### Collaboration Patterns Observed

- Structured feedback (numbered lists)
- Meta-awareness (thinking about the process)
- Appropriate deferral (tech decisions wait for requirements)
- Anticipatory problem-solving (ask "how will this fail?" early)

## Action Items for Human

### Before Next Session:
1. ✅ Download these three files using blue links in conversation:
   - ROG-PROJECT-GUIDELINES.md
   - ROG-DECISION-LOG.md
   - Session-2024-12-06-summary.md

2. ✅ Save to local `Railroad Operations Game/` folder

3. ✅ **Upload to PROJECT** (not just next chat) so they persist:
   - Look for "Add to Project" option when uploading
   - Verify they appear as "Project files"

4. ✅ Consider initializing Git repo in local folder (optional but recommended)

5. ✅ Test workflow: Start new chat, reference project files, verify Claude can access them

### For Next Session (Phase 1: Ideation):
- Share images and context about ROG (Railroad Operations Game)
- Explain domain knowledge (railroad operations)
- Discuss what you want to build
- Begin requirements exploration

---

## Important Discoveries

### Token Counter Not Visible in UI
- Claude tracks internally but user can't see it
- Claude committed to warn at 80%, 90%, 95%
- At 95%, mandatory stop to preserve context

### File Download Workflow
- Files NOT automatically in local folder
- Must click blue download links → view → download button → save locally
- Upload to Project for cross-conversation persistence

### Manual Sync Required
- No automatic sync between Claude.ai and local/Code CLI
- Phase-based ownership: Claude.ai for planning, local for implementation
- Decision Log maintained locally, shared excerpts as needed

---

## Current Token Usage

**~23% capacity** (~44,847 / 190,000 tokens) - plenty of room for Phase 1

---

## Next Session Start Checklist

When you begin the next chat:

1. Say: "Resuming ROG project - starting Phase 1 (Ideation)"
2. Verify: Claude can access project files
3. Context: "We completed Phase 0 setup. Ready to discuss ROG concept."
4. Bring: Images and context for Railroad Operations Game
5. Goal: Fully understand what we want to build

---

## Session End Status

✅ Phase 0 complete  
✅ Framework established  
✅ Operational protocols defined  
✅ Safety mechanisms in place  
✅ Ready for ideation  

**Outstanding:** Actually learning what ROG is! 🚂

## Notes for Portfolio (Phase 6)

This session demonstrates:
- Importance of upfront planning
- Testing assumptions (token counter, file downloads)
- Establishing communication protocols
- Meta-level thinking about process
- Iterative refinement over getting it perfect first time
- Anticipating failure modes before they occur

**Key insight:** Spent entire session on "how to work together" before "what to build" - unusual but valuable approach.
